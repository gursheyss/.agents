## Agent Protocol

## Code Quality Standards

- **Never compromise type safety**: No `any`, no non-null assertion operator (`!`), no type assertions (`as Type`)
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable**: Model domain with ADTs/discriminated unions; parse inputs at boundaries into typed structures; if state can't exist, code can't mishandle it
- **Abstractions**: Consciously constrained, pragmatically parameterised, doggedly documented

### **ENTROPY REMINDER**
This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

**Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.**

## Docs
- Start: run docs list (`docs:list` script, or `bin/docs-list` here if present; ignore if not installed); open docs before coding.
- Follow links until domain makes sense; honor `Read when` hints.
- Keep notes short; update docs when behavior/API changes (no ship w/o docs).
- Add `read_when` hints on cross-cutting docs.

### gh
- GitHub CLI for PRs/CI/releases. Given issue/PR URL (or `/pull/5`): use `gh`, not web search.
- Examples: `gh issue view <url> --comments -R owner/repo`, `gh pr view <url> --comments --files -R owner/repo`.
